        <p>I'm a Software Developer located in Seattle, Washington.</p>
        <p>As both an artist and a frequent traveler, I'm passionate about:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Writing code that develops unique and creative things</li>
          <li>
            Lifelong learning and discovering new things about Web Developing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Exploring as much of the world as I can. Some of my favorite
            countries that I've visited include:
          </li>
          <ol>
            <li>Japan</li>
            <li>Switzerland</li>
            <li>Norway</li>
          </ol>
        </ul>

          Currently, I work in retail, but my passion has always been traveling.
          Last year I left for 3 months to travel through Europe and a couple of
          countries in Africa. While I was traveling, I created a travel blog to
          help inspire others, and I realized that I loved designing my own
          website.

          As a student for Thinkful, I have the opportunity to work in a field
          that gives me the flexibility to travel the world, while also doing
          work that I love.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm always ready for a challenge! If you would like to collaborate,
          please contact me.
